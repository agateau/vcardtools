# vcardtools
Automatically fix, split, normalize, group and merge/deduplicate vCard and VCF files (even large ones).

## Use case

### Splitting

You want to split multiple vCard/VCF files (address books) into individual vCards with the vCard name as the filename.

### Grouping

Identical to splitting, but it will group matching vCards (duplicates) into a directory with the most relevant name (the longuest name found).

### Merging/Deduplicating

Identical to grouping, but instead of grouping matching vCards (duplicates) into a directory it will merge them into one unique vCard file with the most relevant name (the longuest name found).


## Installation

Requires python 3 (tested with 3.4, may work with 3.2).


Clone the sources :
```
git clone https://github.com/mbideau/vcardtools.git vcardtools
```

Install packages requirements:
```
apt install --no-install-recommends python3-pip
```

Create a python virtual environment :
```
python3 -m venv vcardtools
```

Install required python dependencies :
```
pip install vobject
pip install fuzzywuzzy
```

## Usage

Run `python3 vcardtools.py`.

```

               [-t MATCH_RATIO] [-i MATCH_MIN_LENGTH] [-d MATCH_MAX_DISTANCE]
               [-1] [-s] [--move-name-extra-info-to-note]

               [-l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
               DESTDIR FILES [FILES ...]

Automatically fix, split, normalize, group and merge/deduplicate vCard and VCF files (even large ones).

positional arguments:
  DESTDIR               The directory that will contains VCF (vCard) files merged.
  FILES                 The vcf/vcard files that contains vCards.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g, --group           Group vcards that match into a directory.
  -m, --merge           Merge vcards that match into a single file.
  -x, --no-match-approx
                        Disable using approximate matching on names (note:
                        names/words order will count).
  -c, --no-fix-and-convert
                        Disable fixing invalid lines, and broken multilines
                        value, and converting from vCard 2.1 to 3.0
  -n, --no-overwrite-names
                        Do not overwrite names in the vCard, i.e.: keep 'fn'
                        and 'n' attributes untouched
  -f, --french-tweaks   Enable french tweaks (phone number '+33' converted to
                        '0', handling of the name particule ' De ').
  -a MATCH_ATTRIBUTES, --match-attributes MATCH_ATTRIBUTES
                        Use those attributes to match vCards. Specials
                        attributes: 'names' is an alias for 'fn'+'n' and
                        'mobiles' for 'tel'+filter by phone number
  -t MATCH_RATIO, --match-ratio MATCH_RATIO
                        The ratio score to match the names (see fuzzywuzzy
                        documentation). Default is: 100 (safe).
  -i MATCH_MIN_LENGTH, --match-min-length MATCH_MIN_LENGTH
                        The minimum length of string to allow an approximate
                        match. Default is: 5.
  -d MATCH_MAX_DISTANCE, --match-max-distance MATCH_MAX_DISTANCE
                        The number of character between to length of names
                        that matches. Default is: 3.
  -1, --no-match-same-first-letter
                        Do not ensure that name's first letter match when
                        doing approximate matching
  -s, --match-startswith
                        Use the startswith comparizon (using --match-max-
                        distance) when doing approximate matching
  --move-name-extra-info-to-note
                        Move name's charaecters between parentheses or braces
                        to note attribute
  --no-remove-name-in-email
                        Do not removes name in email, i.e.: keep email like
                        the following untouched: "John Doe" <john@doe.com>
  -l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        the logging level in (DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR),
                        default is: INFO
```

## Notes

It outputs only vCard 3.0 format, but accept 2.1 and 3.0 vCard format (even mixed).

It uses logging as output, so adjust verbosity by adjusting the log level.


## Tips

If you already have multiple individual vCard/VCF file that you want to group/merge, just re-combine them together before runing the tool. They will be re-splitted and grouped/merged.

To combine multiple vCard/VCF file into one, just do :
```
cat *.vcard >> all.vcf
```
